### Introduction

Our robot was designed to compete in the Sri Lankan Robotics Challenge 2024. The robot utilizes a Raspberry Pi 4B for color detection and alignment, while the main control logic is handled by an STM32 microcontroller. The project combines various hardware and software components to achieve precise control and functionality.

The repository contains the codes used for the microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi, schematics, PCB Design and 3D enclosure design.

Following are the tasks capable by the robot:
* Line detection and following
* Wall colour detection
* Floor colour detection
* Object detection between a cube and a cylinder
* Shooting a ball into a target

The robot is entirely autonomous.
